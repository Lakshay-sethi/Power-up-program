# Final Project: Microsoft Power Up Program
Welcome to my final project for the Microsoft Power Up Program! In this project, I leveraged a combination of Microsoft Power Platform tools to build an animal shelter management system. 

### **Microsoft Power up challenge :** https://powerup.microsoft.com/

## Components
### 1. Dataverse Tables
   
Used Dataverse to create and manage relational data storage. This is where data is securely stored and accessed for various processes in the project. Dataverse ensures high performance and seamless integration with other Microsoft services.

### 2. Model Driven Web App
   
Built a Model Driven Web App to offer a rich, data-centric interface. The app connects directly to Dataverse and allows users to interact with the data, providing a seamless and efficient experience for both input and viewing.

### 3. SharePoint Canvas Web App

Developed a SharePoint Canvas Web App for creating a user-friendly interface to interact with the data. This app allows users to easily input, update, and view the data stored in Dataverse, offering a responsive and intuitive user experience.

### 4. Power Automate Flows

Built several Power Automate Flows to automate business processes. These flows are triggered by user actions or specific conditions, helping to streamline workflows, send notifications, and integrate with other systems for enhanced productivity.

### 5. Power BI Dashboard

Created a Power BI Dashboard to visualize key metrics and data insights. The dashboard pulls data from Dataverse and presents it in a comprehensive, easy-to-understand format, enabling decision-makers to gain valuable insights quickly.
